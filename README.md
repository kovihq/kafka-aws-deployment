# kafka-aws-deployment
This project deploys Kafka and part of it's ecosystem to AWS through terraform.  
It is mainly developed to help people that want to learn/explore the technology, focused - but not limited - to stream database events.

What is included:

* Kafka Core - AWS MSK
* Kafka Components - AWS ECS
   - Kafka Connect (debezium, by `https://debezium.io/` through https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/connect)
   - Kafka Connect UI (by `Landoop` through https://hub.docker.com/r/landoop/kafka-connect-ui)
   - Kafka Schema Registry (by `Confluent` through https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-schema-registry/tags/)
   - Kafka Schema Registry UI (by `Landoop` through https://hub.docker.com/r/landoop/schema-registry-ui/)
   - Kafka Rest Proxy API (by `Confluent` through https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-kafka-rest)
   - Kafka KSQL Server (by `Confluent` through https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-ksql-server)
* VPC
* Load Balancer

## Prerequisites

You need the following to deploy the project:

* AWS account https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/  
      - Create an S3 bucket to store terraform state files https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html  
      - Create EC2 key pair https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html  

* Install Make (optional but recommended). Choose one of the following:  
      - Using chocolatey (package manager): https://chocolatey.org/packages/make  
      - Manual installation: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm  

* Install Terraform:  
      - Using chocolatey (package manager): https://chocolatey.org/packages/terraform  
      - Manual installation: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html  

* AWS CLI installed with a profile set on your machine:  
      - Using chocolatey (package manager): https://chocolatey.org/packages/awscli  
      - Manual installation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html  
      IMPORTANT: After installing it please configure a profile: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration

## Usage

   Before you deploy anything you need to make sure variables are set as expected on `aws-infrastructure\configuration`.  
   There are 5 configuration files where most variables are set with default values. *However*, there is a section on top of each file called **NEED CONFIGURATION** that needs your manual configuration.

## AWS Architecture

Important Notes:
   
   The architecture is designed for Kafka exploration and not a proper production deployment.
   
   * An autoscaling group is in place to facilitate the addition of new containers without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. You can change min, max and desired number of instances on this file `aws-infrastructure\configuration\ecs-config.tfvars`
